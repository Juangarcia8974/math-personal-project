# math-personal-project
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Program that helps the user in any area of math(Im 19 so my level is not nearly enough to cover every single one of them). The ideal goal would be that even tho the user doesnt know anything about the topic, he could solve every problem. </p>

<h1>¿Why am I doing this?</h1>
<p>I am doing this because when Im doing any math problem to practice, study... I have no way of checking or knowing if what im doing is correct or not if I dont have the answers. With this program, hopefully, whoever uses it wont have that problem anymore. The main reason tho is because I like math and recently got into programming a lot</p>

<h1>Current State</h1>
<p>I think I did a decent job for geometry (points, lines, vectors and planes) but thats the only thing I have done so far.</p>

<h2>Geometry</h2>
<h3>Functions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create:To create points, lines, planes...</li>
  <li>Show:To see what you have created uptil now.</li>
  <li>Compare:To compare two or three things you have created.</li>
  <li>Edit:To edit something you have created.</li>
  <li>Find:To find a new (point, line, plane...) based on what the user has created and wants to use(clearer explanation later on)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example Problem: </h3>
<p>Find the relative position of the line r relative the plane &pi;:</br> 
r:==(x,y,z)=(5,2,-3)+&lambda;(7,0,0)<br>
&pi;:==2x-y+z+11=0<br></p>
<p>First I create the line and the Plane</p>

<h1>Extra Information</h1>
<p>Every example problem has been taken randomly from a math book</p>
<p>Any suggestions in regards to the code, the idea or to how im managing the github page will be greatly appreciated. I dont know very well how github works yet but any questions or requests can be asked to juangarcialopez8974@gmail.com</p>
<p>Im more than happy to collaborate with people if they want to:)</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>Juan Garcia Lopez</p>
